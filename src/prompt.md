You are working inside an existing React + Vite + Tailwind + TypeScript project.

You must obey the rules in AGENT.md and copilot-instructions.md.

Your task is to build some pages from Figma: the User Profile pages.

Rules:
- Copy the structure and style of the reference page I provide
- Do not introduce new patterns
- Use Tailwind exactly as used in the project
- Make the page fully responsive
- Use Axios from axios.ts if data is needed
- Use React Router pattern from App.tsx
- Use React Hook Form + Zod if forms are present

Figma Link:

Reference Page/ui screen from the ui/ux figma link:
["https://www.figma.com/design/4ikQ4xbqhB1AuXbsHcy6S9/Elycapvest-Luxury-Homes?node-id=316-2&t=pIaQgTkJupndvzr0-0" "https://www.figma.com/design/4ikQ4xbqhB1AuXbsHcy6S9/Elycapvest-Luxury-Homes?node-id=317-256&t=pIaQgTkJupndvzr0-0" "https://www.figma.com/design/4ikQ4xbqhB1AuXbsHcy6S9/Elycapvest-Luxury-Homes?node-id=317-516&t=pIaQgTkJupndvzr0-0" "https://www.figma.com/design/4ikQ4xbqhB1AuXbsHcy6S9/Elycapvest-Luxury-Homes?node-id=317-633&t=pIaQgTkJupndvzr0-0"]

Reference Page from the codebase: just for examples
[InvestorDashboard.tsx]

Now generate:
1. The page file
2. Any small components needed
3. Where each file should live
4. The route addition in App.tsx
